lsx - list executables
======================
Prints all executable file names of given absolute paths to standard output.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (lsx is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install lsx (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running lsx
-----------
Simply invoke the 'lsx' with arbitrary paths as arguments.
